Pretty much everyone who owns a Raspberry Pi has written a script to dump all
the useful system information in one go; this one is mine.

It takes no arguments and dumps the following to stdout:
  - CPU and GPU temperatures in centigrade
  - CPU voltage (with separate over-voltage component when present)
  - CPU minimum, maximum and current frequencies
  - CPU frequency governor mode and upscale threshold
  - Hostname and any non-loopback IP addresses
  - Firmware date and version
  - Enabled and disabled media codecs.


To install the script run "python ./setup.py install" with the appropriate
privileges.
